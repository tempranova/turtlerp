Beta fixes
- Removing any quotation verification from chat-line emote; only present on chat box emote verification
- Otherwise, chat line emotes are reset with every press so errors do not continue after typos
- No validation error should appear for other players anymore
- NOTE: if a link is included in the text, and you are using Shagu / PFUI, the text will be mis-formatted because Shagu adds a white color after a link
- Validation checking for "~", "°", or "§" in any saved text
- No longer possible to save characters above, so users should never see them in their own profile (requires a new save to validate, will not work if user already has these characters in the profile)
- "%" character now allowed in emotes
- Hiding map icons correctly when changing frames on world map
  - TEST: possible error with characters on different continents, then moving back to your own continent, players misaligned on map
- Removed edges from Dark UI Description
- Titles on descriptions no longer replaced when new "Glances" open
- Data "sends" will now use "p" as the character name (just a placeholder for 'player'); using message sender instead, more reliable
- Mechanisms for cleaning directory (removing players with bad characters)
- Mechanism to delete single player from directory (manually remove characters as desired)
